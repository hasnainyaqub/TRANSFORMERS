## 🤖 What is a Transformer?

A **Transformer** is a deep learning architecture based on the **self-attention mechanism** that processes entire sequences in parallel instead of step by step.  
It learns contextual relationships between tokens (words, patches, etc.) efficiently, making it faster and more scalable than traditional models like RNNs and LSTMs.

**Key Components:**
- Encoder-Decoder structure  
- Multi-Head Self-Attention  
- Positional Encoding  
- Feedforward Neural Networks  
- Residual Connections and Layer Normalization

## 🌍 Impact of Transformers

Transformers revolutionized AI by introducing parallel computation and global attention.  
They made it possible to train massive models like **BERT, GPT, T5, ViT**, and **Whisper**, enabling state-of-the-art results across domains:
- Text understanding and generation  
- Machine translation  
- Image classification  
- Speech recognition  
- Multimodal and generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.)

## 📜 The Origin Story!

Before Transformers, RNNs and LSTMs were the backbone of sequence modeling.  
However, they struggled with **long dependencies**, **slow training**, and **vanishing gradients**.  
In **2017**, Vaswani et al. introduced the paper **“Attention is All You Need”**, which replaced recurrence with **self-attention**, leading to faster and more effective models.

## ⚡ Attention is All You Need (2017)

This groundbreaking paper introduced the **Transformer model** at Google Research.  
It proposed:
- Self-attention as the core of sequence learning  
- Parallel processing of sequences (no recurrence)  
- Multi-head attention for capturing diverse relationships  
- Encoder-decoder architecture for translation tasks  

This architecture became the foundation for modern large language models (LLMs).
