# 🎯 Attention Mechanism

The **Attention Mechanism** is one of the most important innovations in deep learning, introduced to help models focus on the most relevant parts of an input sequence when making predictions.  
It was first proposed by Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2015) in their paper *“Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.”* [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473)]

## 🧠 What Is Attention?

In traditional Seq2Seq models, the entire input is compressed into a single **context vector**, which can cause performance issues for long sentences.  
The **Attention Mechanism** solves this by allowing the model to **look at (attend to)** different parts of the input dynamically while generating each output token.

In simple terms:  
> Attention tells the model *“where to look”* when producing the next word.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **encoder** processes the input sequence and produces hidden states for each token.  
2. The **decoder** computes an **attention score** between its current state and each encoder hidden state.  
3. These scores are normalized (using softmax) to form **attention weights**.  
4. A **context vector** is calculated as the weighted sum of encoder outputs.  
5. The decoder uses this context to generate the next output token.

## 🔢 Mathematical Formulation

Given encoder hidden states \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T\) and the decoder state \(s_t\):

1. **Score function:**  
   \[
   e_{t,i} = \text{score}(s_t, h_i)
   \]
2. **Attention weights:**  
   \[
   \alpha_{t,i} = \frac{\exp(e_{t,i})}{\sum_j \exp(e_{t,j})}
   \]
3. **Context vector:**  
   \[
   c_t = \sum_i \alpha_{t,i} \, h_i
   \]

This context vector \(c_t\) helps the decoder decide which parts of the input are most relevant at each step.

## 🧩 Types of Attention

| Type                        | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bahdanau (Additive)**     | Uses a feed-forward network to compute attention scores.       |
| **Luong (Multiplicative)**  | Uses a dot product for faster computation.                      |
| **Self-Attention**          | Each token attends to every other token (used in Transformers).|
| **Multi-Head Attention**    | Uses multiple attention layers to learn different relationships in parallel.|

## 🧠 Summary

The Attention Mechanism enables models to selectively focus on relevant information instead of treating all inputs equally.  
It laid the foundation for **self-attention** and **Transformers**, which power nearly all modern NLP and AI systems.

✨ **In short:**  
Attention helps models decide *what to focus on* — making neural networks smarter, faster, and more context-aware.
