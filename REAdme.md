# ⚡ Transformers

The **Transformer** architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 through the paper *“Attention Is All You Need”*, revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning.  
It replaced traditional recurrent models (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) with **self-attention**, allowing the model to process entire sequences in parallel rather than step by step.

## 🧠 What Are Transformers?

Transformers use an **Encoder-Decoder** structure:
- The **Encoder** reads and represents the input sequence.
- The **Decoder** generates the output sequence while attending to the encoder’s information.

Unlike RNNs, Transformers rely entirely on **attention mechanisms**, which help capture **long-range dependencies** efficiently.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🧩 **Self-Attention**: Learns contextual relationships between words across a sequence.  
- ⚡ **Parallel Processing**: Enables faster training compared to RNN-based models.  
- 📏 **Positional Encoding**: Preserves word order information without recurrence.  
- 🔁 **Scalability**: Works efficiently for large datasets and long sequences.  
- 🌍 **Transferability**: Forms the backbone of large-scale pre-trained models.
